# Domino-Experiment
My first graduate level project. In it, I compare the performance of uninformed and informed search algorithms for the 4-sided dominoes problem. You will be given N2 tiles (N = {2,3,4}) and will be asked to arrange them in an NxN grid in a way that adjacent tiles have the same number in their neighboring sides. The tiles cannot be rotated.
