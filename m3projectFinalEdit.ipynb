You will be given N<sup>2</sup> tiles (N = {2,3,4}) and will be asked to arrange them in an NxN grid in a way that adjacent tiles have the same number in their neighboring sides. The tiles cannot be rotated. See the example below for N=3.\n",

    "## Solution description\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods implemented: \n",
    "For this project, I implemented two search algorithms. Breadth-First Search (BFS) and A* Search.\n",
    "Both algorithms aim to find a solution path from the initialk state to the goal state of the Four Dominoes puzzle. \n",
    "### Search space\n",
    "\n",
    "Format, size, start, goal, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search space for the Four Dominnoes puzzle consits of all possible arrangements of dominoes on a square grid.\n",
    "The size of the grid varies depending on the puzzle size, with dimensions ranging from 2x2 to 4x4. The start state \n",
    "represents thje initial arrangement of dominoes randomly generated within the constraints of the puzzle size.\n",
    "The goal state is reached when all dominoes are correctly placed relative to their adjacent tiles, satisfying the puzzle's constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successor function\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works? Average number of successors? Etc. \n",
    "The successor function generates all poissible successor states from a given state by swapping the positions of two dominoes. \n",
    "It iterates over each domino in the grid and considers all valid swaps with other dominoes. This ensures that all potential \n",
    "configurations are explored. It works by iterating through all pairs of tiles in the NxN grid and generating anew state for\n",
    "each swap of two tiles. This is done for all possible pairs of tiles in the grid, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the \n",
    "state space. The average number of successors depend on the number of tiles in the grid, N^2. For a grid of size N, the total \n",
    "number of possible swaps would be equivalent to (N^2 * (N^2-1))/2. However, since the expirement only considers valid swaps, the \n",
    "actual number of successors is loweer. For example, for a 2x2 grid, there is only 1 possible swap to be made. For a 3x3 grid, there are\n",
    "(9x8)/2 possible swaps, and for a 4x4 grid, there are (16x15)/2 possible swaps.  Some states that would be impossible to each are dominoes that are\n",
    "in the same positon, as swappinga  domino with itself does not generate a new state and isn't considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heuristic function\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works? Admissible? \n",
    "\n",
    "The huristic function I used in this iteration of the experiment was derived from my first attempt at the project.\n",
    "The function estimates the cost to reach the goal state from the current state by counting the number of mismatched \n",
    "edges and incorrectly placed dominoes. This heuristic is not admissible, however, the greedy best search algorithm \n",
    "does not require an admissible heuristic for it to function properly. To check for mismatched edges, the function \n",
    "iterates through each tile in the grid and checks if the edges match with the adjacent tiles. For each mismatch, it \n",
    "increments a counter. The second part of my heuristic function checks if the dominoes are correctly placed by verifying \n",
    "sides of each tile. The total heuristic value is the sum of mismatched edges and incorrectly placed dominoes. \n",
